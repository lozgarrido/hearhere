**HearHere** analyzes the opinion generated by banks around their branches to improve their acceptance in each community.

## About

### Requeriments

Install the needed libraries for the project:

```
pip3 install requests
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install bs4
pip3 install googlemaps
```

### First steps

Open the *main.ipynb* file with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) and follow the instructions.

A valid [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) API key is needed to update the database. If you have one, you can edit the *api_keys.py* file with it.


## Files structure

### Code

- **main.ipynb**: Jupyter file with HH queries setup and visualization
- **scrapers.py**: Download data from web
- **config.py**: Project paths configuration
- api_keys.py*

### Folders
